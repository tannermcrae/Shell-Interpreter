Shell-Interpreter
=================

This is a working shell interpreter written in C/C++ for a linux machine.

Made this for my Systems Programming course at Purdue University.

To run:
  - Open up a terminal window.
  - Go to the root directory (Shell-Interpreter) and type make.
  - Type shell.
  
Run test cases by:
  - Moving to Test-Shell directory and typing testall.
  - Note: I did not write the test cases.
